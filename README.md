# Milestone Project One: Champion guide
In this project, I hope to display the skills I have learnt so far in coding appealing and eye-catching websites using HTML and CSS. 
League of Legends is one of the biggest MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) games around with 151 unique champions to currently pick and choose from.
The purpose of my project is to give insight and indepth knowledge of one of those champions, Lucian. Lucian has one of the biggest skill gaps when comparing new 
and experienced players, the main goal of my website is to help bridge that gap.

Most League of Legends players choose to 'main' a role and a champ. This means they put most of their play time into their specific position (Top, jungle, Mid, Bot and Support).
Players then also further specialise by putting most of their time into a few specific champions that do well in their preferred role. LoL sites usually focus most of their attention 
on the statistics of a champ and how their winrate is performing during the current patch (most patches last two weeks). By presenting the information I have, gained throufh play experience,
and by then presenting it in a more graphical nature, my aim is to help players gain more knowledge on champs they may not be comfortable playing.

## UX
One thing all champions have in common is 3 basic abilites and 1 ultimate ability bound to 4 separate keys (usually QWER) that have varying cooldowns after use.
Champs can also have multiple passive effects which can make learning a champion's combos and playstyle quite daunting. 

My goal as owner of the webpage is to help newer players understand the champion Lucian, by learning his combos and his strengths.

Users are league of Legends players looking to increase their knowledge and skill level in regards to playing Lucian.

Main features to include are:
* A full page background showcasing Lucian's 'Splashart' (As league of legends has a very capable and talented artwork team)
* An interactive 3d image carousel used to navigate to different pages within my site (Bonus feature)
* Embed video from YouTube with controls added so video can be paused and started (The video will show gameplay of Lucian and using his abilities)

## Features
### Full Width Backgrounds
* League of Legends is a game with beautiful iamges, called splash arts, used to depict their champions in different settings/situations. I wanted
to use these images as full width backgrounds - as a way of showcasing them.

### Load In Animation
* Inspired from the courses Love Running project, there's a slight zoom effect as the page is loaded. This brings even more attention to the full width images.

### Gifs 
* All gifs are from either in game footage or game cinematics. this helps produce a positive response from users as they can see 
chaaracters they may know in action.

### Font Awesome Icons
* Font awesome icons help sections/words stand out or link to their content (coin icons referring to the ingame currency gold) which helps elicit a positive
emotional response from users.

### Interactive Cards
* 3 interactive cards, gold hover effect, with a teaser of the section they link to. Example, the card that describes lucian laning links to 3 of the top supports that he likes to lane with.

### Responsive table
* With 18 skill points available to be spent on a champions 4 abilities, a table was the best way to respresent this data. This allows a user to quickly see at glance where to spend 
their skill points.

### Collapse
* I made use of a few collapse elements, sourced from bootstrap, to help me display the abilities I described on my abilities page. 
By using a collapse instead of regular iFrames, it helps bring more interactivity into my site whilst also giving users an action to perform whilst using my site.

### Youtube Embed videos
* Embedding youtube videos of a champions abilities in action, allows the user to visually see the ability in action next to its explanation.

### Bootstrap Progress Bars 
* A visual representation of data rather than just the usual win-rate with/vs x champion. This will help users understand the why behind the data.

## Features Left to Implement
Potential features to include:
* A forum style page where people can post comments about the state of the champ and his best item build path
* More pages on other Champs from League of Legends. Currently the two links in my dropdown circle back to my home page. In the full site, these would link to their own specific 
guides

## Technologies Used
* HTML (links to be added)
  * Used to create the basic structure of my page

* Bootstrap
  * Used to make styling my page easier
  * Bootstraps java library is also used for two elements, namely the nav collapse and for my tooltips

* CSS
  * Used to make my website unique

* Cloudinary
  * Cloudinary was used as a CDN to help speed up the load times of my site as all my images are hosted there.
